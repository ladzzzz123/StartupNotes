<p>I think this will be the perfect platform to use to start building a library of blog posts as ideas may come up without putting a burden on myself to have a specific due date for each blog post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ideally, most blog post ideas will originate from a challenge endured or worked around during the week in one way or another, whether it is</p>
<ol>
<li>Some code sample or solution that helped me solve a problem</li>
<li>A process or configuration in ViciDial that may help people</li>
<li>A definitive guide on how to properly configure webrtc2sip in order to work with a ViciDIAL asterisk server</li>
</ol>

<p>My blog may cover a variety of topics.  I haven’t decided yet if I want to use 2supergeeks as my platform or if I should make a personal blog, or if I should create a NandoTech company blog.  Everything being what it is, and I currently being the only real technical writer on staff, I’m leaning toward making it my own personal blog just specifically branded to the company itself.</p>

<li>Basically for now I think I’ll make it the “NandoTech Blog” which will basically be just me making several posts.  As we have it there are just the few that I’ve written in the past.</li>
<li>This will be my real opportunity to start compiling a real list and maybe even finish up the StartUp Notes compilation and publish that to a blog</li>
